Maggie
======

Maggie the little sister of lisa, acts like a memory cache for FsXML elements. Using the Mojo talks to 
lisa, smithers to provide getting/searching for data-elements. Currently still hardcoded for the euscreen
project and mostly a placeholder.

1) Check out Maggie in Eclipse
2) Build a war using the 'deploy-war' task with the provided build.xml
3) Deploy the war on a Tomcat server

Doesn't do anything directly is a providing service to the mojo org.springfield.fs.* classes.
